# Hint Code for OCaml HW2

## About
* Still, not mandatory to be used.

## About the Files
* [hw2tree_hint.py](./hw2tree_hint.py)
    * This piece of code introduces the structure of tree, and tree traversals. If you are already familiar with the tree structure, skip it.
* [hw2_matcher2parser.py](./hw2_matcher2parser.py)
    * Many felt it easy implementing a matcher, but get confused how to move on to parser; this is how (in logic only; you still need to write your own implementation).
* [option.ml](./option.ml)
    * You are not allowed to use the library functions in [Option](http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/doc/Option.html). But listed here are some easy replacements of those library functions.
