# Hint Code for OCaml HW1

## About this hint (and all the future hint code in CS131)
* It is **NOT MANDATORY** to use hint code, we encourage independent thinking.
* Don't take us wrong, hint code is not something you use to translate into your solution. Try to design your own solution first, and get some inspirations from hint code whenever get stucked.
