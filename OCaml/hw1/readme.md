# Hint Code for OCaml HW1

## About this hint (and all the future hint code in CS131)
* It is **NOT MANDATORY** to use hint code, we encourage independent thinking.
* Don't take us wrong, hint code is not something you use to translate into your solution. 
    * Try to design your own solution first, and get some inspirations from hint code whenever get stucked.
* Solving HW1 independently will be super helpful when you move on to HW2. 
    * HW2 is much harder than & closely related to HW1, and is widely-known as the hardest homework in CS131. Working on HW1 independently will increase your chance of survival in HW2, and the rest of this course.
    * Many students decided to drop after the deadline of HW2.
