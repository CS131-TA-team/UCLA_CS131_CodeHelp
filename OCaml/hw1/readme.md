# Hint Code for OCaml HW1

## About this hint (and all the future hint code in CS131)
* It is **NOT MANDATORY** to use hint code, we encourage independent thinking.
* **WARNING**: if you "strictly follow" the hint code, you'll **never** reach the solution, and you'll have **a lot of problem with OCaml variable types**. It is **only** good for telling you the logic. **It is a tragedy if you do translation.**
* Don't take us wrong, hint code is not something you use to translate into your solution. 
    * Try to design your own solution first, and get some inspirations from hint code whenever get stucked.
* Solving HW1 independently will be super helpful when you move on to HW2. 
    * You need to get yourself familiarized with **functional programming** style sooner (HW1) or later (HW2).
    * HW2 is much harder than & closely related to HW1, and is widely-known as the hardest homework in CS131. Working on HW1 independently will increase your chance of survival in HW2, and the rest of this course.
    * Many students decided to drop after the deadline of HW2. 

## OCaml Starter Resource
* [The Official Website](https://ocaml.org/)
* [Installation Guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html)
    * Installing locally on your own machine will help you work on it easier.
* [The OCaml Manual](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/index.html)
    * Special requirements in **HW1**: only library functions in [Pervasives](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html) and in [List](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html) are allowed.
* An [online interpreter](https://try.ocamlpro.com/) to play with.
* Xinyu provided code for [OCaml Basics](./OCaml_Vasics.ml). You may run it line by line to get yourself started with OCaml.
* Some [hints](./python_hint.py) are provided in Python. If you don't know Python you can use it as pseudo-code. 

## Currying
* It is not required to understand currying in HW1, but if you are curious, please check for official explanation of [currying](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/functional_programming.html#Partial-function-applications-and-currying), and also see if [this](./currying/) helps.
* Currying will be covered in your midterm & final.
