# UCLA CS131 Coding Helper

## Description
This reporitory is a collection of helpful materials that might give you a better experience in learning CS131 taught by [Prof. Eggert](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/paul-eggert/). Previous quarter helper code could be find in other *branches* (not the master branch).

## Written in Advance
1. Nothing could be more important than the textbook (We refer to as Webber)
    * [Modern Programming Languages: 2nd Edition (A Practical Introduction) Author: Adam Brooks Webber](http://www.webber-labs.com/mpl/)
        * including slides and corrections of textbook and code on their website
    * Typically, the whole textbook is covered in your final exam. 
2. Please do goto the lectures and take notes.
3. Please start early on everything, especially the homework, you may find them take much longer than expected.

## Announcements
* CS131 homework and projects
    - TA will grade your homework
    - By some automatic grading scripts (so that's fair - but those scripts are generally bad in taking care of compilation errors / unexpected variable names, please be careful)
    - **HW5** simplest grading script with all test cases omitted is [available here](https://github.com/CS131-TA-team/hw5-grading-script), please go through it carefully and use it wisely.
    - **Project** grading script is an enriched complex version of [this sample code](https://github.com/CS131-TA-team/CS131-Project-Sample-Grading-Script), please make sure that your code gets along with this script before your final submission. Feel free to use the sample code as a client that helps you make sure that your servers do the right thing.
* CS131 exams
    - Graded on GradeScope
    - Midterms grading details will be released to students on GradeScope, but for finals, normally won't
    - Regrading requests are always welcomed for midterm and final, but we don't wait forever for the regrading requests, if you do want a regrade please submit a regrading request on GradeScope (midterm, when this option is valid), or reach out to your TAs ASAP asking for it (final, when we don't show you the details, you can ask for them in person).
* CS131 score punishment
    - Exponential (<= 1 day -1%, <= 2 days -2%, <=3 days -4%, etc.)
