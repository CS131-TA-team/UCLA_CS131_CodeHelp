# Hint Code for Prolog

## About
* Still, not mandatory to be used.
* Remember it is gnu-prolog, not swi-prolog

## Getting Started
- Open terminal and type in gprolog to the toplevel, and exit by CTRL&D or CTRL&C + e
- [visualization](http://www.cdglabs.org/prolog/#/)

### Example
1. Have your code ready in, e.g. *hello.pl*
2. Enter gprolog to the toplevel.
3. From prolog toplevel, consult your code by either of the following ways:
    * ```[hello].```
    * ```consult(hello).```
4. Then you can run all the queries. e.g. ```ancestor(john,Who).```
5. To debug: trace. (and exit by notrace.)
