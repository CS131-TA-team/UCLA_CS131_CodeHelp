# Hint Code for Scheme

The relation is that, LISP ==(simplified)==> Scheme ==(a popular variation)==> Racket

## Getting Started
- [Official Website](https://racket-lang.org/) (including installation guide, etc.)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/), *including* the [racket guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html)
- Probably will need to add it to the path manually on your local machine, e.g. if you use mac, then:
    ```shell
    echo $PATH
    PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Racket\ v7.4/bin
    ```

## About the Resources
- [hello.ss](./hello.ss)
    * Simply a hello-world in Scheme
- [starting_hint.ss](./starting_hint.ss)
    * If, by any chance, you can't figure out where to get started, please try to view this problem as solving many different cases one-by-one, and feel free to use this piece of code to get yourself started.
    * But this is not the only option, neither the best one. Can you come up with shorter solution / more elegant design of the helper functions? If yes, be confident and use your unique ones instead.
- [Sample Grading Script of HW5 with NO actual test cases (provided by Xinyu)](https://github.com/CS131-TA-team/hw5-grading-script)
    * This script will help you avoid compile error, wrong-name error, etc.
- [Stronger Test Cases (Designed by Xinyu)](./Xinyu_Stronger_test_cases.txt)
    * These test cases will not guarantee you a full score, but will give you a higher chance of spotting bugs
